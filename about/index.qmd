# Welcome to my website!
I am Zeng Yanyu, from a prosperous city in southern China - Shenzhen. Adjacent to Hong Kong, Shenzhen is a vibrant coastal city, the window of China's reform and opening up, creating the world-renowned “Shenzhen Speed”, known as “China's Silicon Valley”.
Growing up in this dynamic and innovative city, I was deeply influenced by its open and tolerant cultural atmosphere, and gradually shaped my own independent, optimistic and courageous exploration personality.
I am passionate about participating in various social practices and volunteer activities. In addition to regular volunteering activities, I have also participated in three “three trips to the countryside” activities, during which I experienced more meaning of life. At the same time, I am also a person who likes traveling and exploring food, I have been to Xiamen, Wuzhen, Yunnan, Changsha, Chongqing and other places. I especially like the city of Chongqing, which is known as the “Fog City” and also the “8D Magic City”. Chongqing has many specialties, and my favorite is hot pot.
China is a vast country with different customs, welcome to China!
